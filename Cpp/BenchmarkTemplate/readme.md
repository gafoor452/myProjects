# Template project to compare benchmarks

Copy this project to another folder and in that folder test the benchmarks you wish to test.
Please do not change this project because it must be a template to spare efforts to start developing benchmarks for whatever needs.
This would be similar to a maven archetype. 

Run this from command line in the WORKSPACE folder like:
bazel-bin/app/app {repetition_number} {benchmark_type}
